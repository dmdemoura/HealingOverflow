#### Healing Overflow

Download it at: https://dmdemoura.itch.io/healing-overflow

You are a healer in an MMORPG, and of course the only healer in your noob filled party. Try to keep everyone alive, else you might get banned for not doing your job.

Be careful, because if you overheal someone too much they will duplicate, and eventually fill your screen.

Also try not to heal your enemies.
